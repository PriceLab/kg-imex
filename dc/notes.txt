I've included our developer tool that allows you to visualize your
individual mcfs. It even color codes the different types of nodes like
enumerations and quantities in the rendered table of the entity.

This is a link to the tool:

And here is the documentation:

Here is additional documentation on the MCF format which you might find useful:
